You can use the provided SQL structure for calculating Month-over-Month growth percentages. Below is the SQL query tailored for your request:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    month_id,\n    SUM(amt) as amt,\n    SUM(amt_notax) as amt_notax,\n    SUM(amt_notax) / SUM(lm_amt_notax) - 1 AS amt_notax_mom_per\nFROM\n    dm_fact_sales_chatbi\nWHERE\n    date_code BETWEEN TO_CHAR(DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', '2025-02-01'), 'YYYY-MM-DD') AND TO_CHAR(DATEADD(day, -1, '2025-02-20'), 'YYYY-MM-DD')\n    AND region = 'APAC EC'\nGROUP BY\n    month_id;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Date Range**: The `date_code` filters the data from the start of current February up to the day before today (February 19, 2025).\n- **Region**: The region 'APAC EC' is specified to ensure the sales data is filtered specifically for the Asia-Pacific electronic commerce channels.\n- **MOM Calculation**: The MOM percentage (`amt_notax_mom_per`) is calculated by dividing the `amt_notax` of the current month by `lm_amt_notax` (last month's tax-free amount) and subtracting one. This provides the growth rate as a decimal percentage value.\n\nAdjust any specifics such as column names or calculation methods according to your database schema and requirements.",
