From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\\nFormat each relationship as (\\\"relationship\\\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\\n\\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\\nFormat the content-level key words as (\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\\n\\n4.
