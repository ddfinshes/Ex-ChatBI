Since today is February 20, 2025, which is a Thursday, the first day of the current week (Sunday) would be February 16, 2025.

This is derived based on the task requirements and today's date.\n  \n- **Fields Calculated**: The query retrieves the sum of untaxed amounts and target amounts for this period, calculates the achievement rate as defined by the formula: `amt_notax / amt_notax_target - 1`.\n\nThis query structure will help evaluate sales performance specifically for the Week-to-Date period using the predefined date range.

Assuming a standard week starts on Sunday, the specific dates for week 45 can be set based on a calendar.

It then uses the formula (sales / target - 1) to compute the achievement rate and rounds it to 2 decimal places.\n\n• The code assumes the table dm_fact_sales_chatbi includes the relevant data and columns (amt_notax, amt_notax_target, and date_code). \n\nFeel free to adjust the column names or logic if your requirements or database schema differ.",

      "return": "Below is one example of PostgreSQL–compliant SQL code that meets the requirements. In this solution we manually set the date ranges for each week in February 2025 (using today’s date as February 20, 2025) and restrict the query to “comp” stores (assumed to be indicated by comp_flag = 'Y'). The code first aggregates sales (from the dm_fact_sales_chatbi table) for each week in this month and then joins the weekly results to calculate the week-over-week growth percentage. Notice that for the current week (week 3) the date range runs from February 16 to February 19, as today is February 20, 2025.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Define Weekly Aggregation \n──────────────────────────────\nWe use a CTE (weekly_sales) to group sales for each week based on the following manually defined ranges:\n\n• Week 1 (Week number = 1): February 2–8, 2025  \n• Week 2 (Week number = 2): February 9–15, 2025  \n• Week 3 (Week number = 3): February 16–19, 2025\n\nA comp store is filtered by “comp_flag = 'Y'” (as seen in other comp-related queries).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Join Weekly Data and Calculate Growth % \n──────────────────────────────\nWe then self–join the weekly_sales CTE so that for each week (except the first) the previous week’s total sales are used to compute growth. The growth percentage is calculated as (Current Week Sales / Previous Week Sales – 1), and we round the result to two decimals. If the previous week’s sales are zero, the growth is set to 0.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nComplete SQL Code Example\n──────────────────────────────\n\nWITH weekly_sales AS (\n  SELECT\n    CASE\n      WHEN date_code BETWEEN '2025-02-02' AND '2025-02-08' THEN 1\n      WHEN date_code BETWEEN '2025-02-09' AND '2025-02-15' THEN 2\n      WHEN date_code BETWEEN '2025-02-16' AND '2025-02-19' THEN 3\n    END AS week_num,\n    SUM(amt) AS total_sales\n  FROM dm_fact_sales_chatbi\n  WHERE date_code BETWEEN '2025-02-01' AND '2025-02-19'\n    AND comp_flag = 'Y'\n  GROUP BY week_num\n)\n\nSELECT \n  curr.week_num,\n  curr.total_sales AS current_sales,\n  prev.total_sales AS previous_sales,\n  CASE \n    WHEN prev.total_sales = 0 OR prev.total_sales IS NULL THEN 0\n    ELSE ROUND((curr.total_sales::numeric / prev.total_sales - 1) * 100, 2)\n  END AS growth_percentage\nFROM weekly_sales curr\nLEFT JOIN weekly_sales prev ON curr.week_num = prev.week_num + 1\nORDER BY curr.week_num;\n\n──────────────────────────────\nExplanation\n──────────────────────────────\n• The CTE \"weekly_sales\" assigns a week number based on hard–coded date ranges that mirror the week–based restrictions: complete weeks for week 1 and week 2, and a partial week (up to yesterday) for week 3.  \n• The main query self–joins the CTE to associate each week (curr) with the immediately preceding week (prev).  \n• The growth percentage is then computed and rounded; if no previous week exists (e.g. week 1) or its sales sum is zero, we default to 0.\n\nThis SQL code meets the constraints stated and should be executable in PostgreSQL.",

      "return": "Below is one possible PostgreSQL solution. In this example we assume the following:\n\n• Today is February 20, 2025. Therefore “this month” is February 2025 and “yesterday” is February 19, 2025.  \n• The week boundaries are taken as Sunday to Saturday. When the week boundaries span into adjacent months the query only uses the part within February 2025. For example, although the current week (by definition) would run Sunday, February 16 to Saturday, February 22, we restrict the “this month” portion to February 16–19.  \n• Only comp (comparable) stores are included. In our sample we assume that these stores can be identified by joining with edw_dim_store_prod (or by a subquery) using a condition such as comp_flag = 'Y'.  \n\nThe code below uses a common table expression (CTE) to hard‐code the four week segments for February 2025. For each segment the sales amount (amt) is summed from dm_fact_sales_chatbi restricting the date range explicitly. Then a second CTE orders these week segments so that a self join can be used to calculate the week‑over‑week growth percentage (current week sales divided by previous week sales minus one, expressed as a percentage). You can change “amt” to another sales field if needed.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n-- PostgreSQL SQL Code for Weekly Comp Growth % Calculation\n------------------------------------------------------------\n  \nWITH weekly_sales AS (\n  -- Week 1: Only the day in February that falls in the week that started in January.\n  SELECT \n    '2025-02-01'::date AS week_start,\n    '2025-02-01'::date AS week_end,\n    SUM(amt) AS sales\n  FROM dm_fact_sales_chatbi\n  WHERE date_code BETWEEN '2025-02-01' AND '2025-02-01'\n    AND store_code IN (\n      SELECT store_code \n      FROM edw_dim_store_prod \n      WHERE comp_flag = 'Y'\n    )\n\n  UNION ALL\n\n  -- Week 2: From Sunday, February 2 to Saturday, February 8, 2025.\n  SELECT \n    '2025-02-02'::date AS week_start,\n    '2025-02-08'::date AS week_end,\n    SUM(amt) AS sales\n  FROM dm_fact_sales_chatbi\n  WHERE date_code BETWEEN '2025-02-02' AND '2025-02-08'\n    AND store_code IN (\n      SELECT store_code \n      FROM edw_dim_store_prod \n      WHERE comp_flag = 'Y'\n    )\n\n  UNION ALL\n\n  -- Week 3: From Sunday, February 9 to Saturday, February 15, 2025.\n  SELECT \n    '2025-02-09'::date AS week_start,\n    '2025-02-15'::date AS week_end,\n    SUM(amt) AS sales\n  FROM dm_fact_sales_chatbi\n  WHERE date_code BETWEEN '2025-02-09' AND '2025-02-15'\n    AND store_code IN (\n      SELECT store_code \n      FROM edw_dim_store_prod \n      WHERE comp_flag = 'Y'\n    )\n\n  UNION ALL\n\n  -- Week 4: Although the normal week would be Feb 16–22, in this month we only have data up to yesterday, Feb 19.\n  SELECT \n    '2025-02-16'::date AS week_start,\n    '2025-02-19'::date AS week_end,\n    SUM(amt) AS sales\n  FROM dm_fact_sales_chatbi\n  WHERE date_code BETWEEN '2025-02-16' AND '2025-02-19'\n    AND store_code IN (\n      SELECT store_code \n      FROM edw_dim_store_prod \n      WHERE comp_flag = 'Y'\n    )\n),\nordered_sales AS (\n  SELECT \n    week_start,\n    week_end,\n    sales,\n    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY week_start) AS rn\n  FROM weekly_sales\n)\nSELECT \n  curr.week_start,\n  curr.week_end,\n  curr.sales AS current_sales,\n  prev.sales AS previous_sales,\n  CASE \n    WHEN prev.sales = 0 THEN NULL \n    ELSE ROUND(((curr.sales::numeric / prev.sales::numeric) - 1) * 100, 2) \n  END AS growth_percentage\nFROM ordered_sales curr\nLEFT JOIN ordered_sales prev ON curr.rn = prev.rn + 1\nORDER BY curr.week_start;\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExplanation:\n\n1.

The second CTE (ordered_sales) assigns row numbers in ascending order by the week_start date.  \n3. In the final SELECT the current week is joined with the immediately previous week (via rn + 1) so that the week‑over‑week sales growth percentage can be calculated as (current_week_sales / previous_week_sales – 1) * 100.  \n4. The results display the start and end of each week segment, the sales of the current week, the previous week’s sales, and the computed growth percentage.  \n\nThis executable PostgreSQL code meets the requirements using explicit date ranges in place of built-in date functions for week‐based restrictions.",

      "return": "Analysis:  \nThe goal is to calculate the total number of units sold in week 45. As specified, we are using week-based restrictions and, given that today is February 20, 2025 (with the current week identified as week 45 and represented by weekid = 202545), we directly filter the sales data using the weekid. In this scenario, we assume that the sales units are recorded in the \"dm_fact_sales_sku_chatbi\" table under the \"qty\" column. The query aggregates the total quantity (i.e., units) sold in that week.\n\nSQL Code:\n```sql\nSELECT\n    week_id,\n    SUM(qty) AS units_sold\nFROM\n    dm_fact_sales_sku_chatbi\nWHERE\n    week_id = 202545\nGROUP BY\n    week_id;\n```\n\nExplanation:  \nThis SQL query retrieves data from the \"dm_fact_sales_sku_chatbi\" table for week 45 (represented by weekid 202545).

Since today is Thursday, February 20, 2025, we consider the full month of February 2025 (from February 1 to February 28). In this query, we are targeting stores that participate in the comparable analysis (indicated by a comp flag, for example, comp_flag = 'Y'). We then group the sales data by week (using week_id) to compute the sales figures. The growth percentage is calculated by comparing the current period’s sales (amt_notax) with the sales from the corresponding previous period (here represented by lyd_amt_notax) using the formula: current sales / previous sales – 1.\n\nSQL Code:\n```sql\nSELECT \n    week_id,\n    SUM(amt) AS sales_amt,\n    SUM(amt_notax) AS sales_notax,\n    CASE \n        WHEN SUM(lyd_amt_notax) = 0 THEN 0 \n        ELSE (SUM(amt_notax) / SUM(lyd_amt_notax)) - 1 \n    END AS sales_comp_growth_per\nFROM \n    dm_fact_sales_chatbi\nWHERE \n    date_code BETWEEN '2025-02-01' AND '2025-02-28'\n    AND comp_flag = 'Y' -- Only include stores participating in comp analysis\nGROUP BY \n    week_id;\n```\n\nExplanation:  \nThis query first aggregates sales data from the dm_fact_sales_chatbi table for the month of February 2025. The filtering condition “AND comp_flag = 'Y'” ensures that only comparable (comp) stores are considered. The data is grouped by week_id so that the calculations are done on a weekly basis. The sales_comp_growth_per field computes the weekly comparable growth percentage by comparing untaxed sales (amt_notax) to the corresponding previous period's untaxed sales (lyd_amt_notax) using the formula: (current untaxed sales / previous untaxed sales) – 1. If there are no previous period sales (to avoid division by zero), it returns 0. This provides the business users with insights into how the weekly sales performance for comp stores is growing relative to their previous performance during the month.",

      "return": "Analysis:  \nWe interpret “Weekly comp growth % for sales” as the percentage change in sales for comp stores (i.e. those with comp_flag = 'Y') when comparing the current week to the previous week. Given today is Thursday, February 20, 2025, the current week is defined as from Sunday, February 16, 2025 to yesterday, February 19, 2025. To compare, we use the corresponding period last week by subtracting 7 days (i.e. from Sunday, February 9, 2025 to Wednesday, February 12, 2025). The growth percentage is computed with the formula: (Current Week Sales / Last Week Sales) - 1.\n\nSQL Code:  \n```sql\nWITH current_week AS (\n  SELECT\n    SUM(amt) AS curr_sales\n  FROM\n    dm_fact_sales_chatbi\n  WHERE\n    date_code BETWEEN '2025-02-16' AND '2025-02-19'\n    AND comp_flag = 'Y'\n),\nlast_week AS (\n  SELECT\n    SUM(amt) AS prev_sales\n  FROM\n    dm_fact_sales_chatbi\n  WHERE\n    date_code BETWEEN '2025-02-09' AND '2025-02-12'\n    AND comp_flag = 'Y'\n)\nSELECT \n    CASE \n       WHEN l.prev_sales = 0 THEN 0 \n       ELSE ROUND(c.curr_sales / l.prev_sales - 1, 4) \n    END AS weekly_comp_growth_pct,\n    c.curr_sales AS \"Current_Week_Sales\",\n    l.prev_sales AS \"Last_Week_Sales\"\nFROM \n    current_week c, last_week l;\n```\n\nExplanation:  \nThis SQL code first aggregates the sales for comp stores in two periods using common table expressions (CTEs). The \"current_week\" CTE sums sales from February 16 to February 19, 2025 while the \"last_week\" CTE does the same for the period February 9 to February 12, 2025. In the main query, it calculates the weekly comp growth percentage using the formula (curr_sales / prev_sales - 1). If the last week’s sales are zero, it returns 0 to avoid division by zero. The result shows the growth percentage along with both the current week and last week sales amounts, helping business users understand how the sales performance of comp stores has changed from one week to the next.",

In this example, we will assume h represents an aggregate calculation—such as the total sales amount (amt)—for a specific week. Under the given constraints, week-based date restrictions (WTD) will be implemented as a specific date range.

As a result, business users will see the aggregated sales figure over that defined period, which represents the metric “h” based on our assumption.

      "return": "Analysis:  \nFor the WTD sales vs target query, we need to compute the sales achievement rate for the week-to-date period. In this scenario, \"WTD\" means from the Sunday of the current week to yesterday. Given that today is Thursday, February 20, 2025, the date range is fixed as February 16, 2025 (Sunday) to February 19, 2025 (yesterday). The query will sum the untaxed sales (amt_notax) and their corresponding targets (amt_notax_target) over this period.

The steps are as follows:  \n• We restrict the data to the current month by setting the date range from '2025-02-01' to '2025-02-28'.  \n• We filter for comp stores by using the condition comp_flag = 'Y'.  \n• We group the data by week_id to calculate total sales (amt) per week.  \n• Finally, we use a window function (LAG) to obtain the previous week’s sales and compute the growth percentage using the formula (current_week_sales / previous_week_sales - 1).  \nNote that we avoid built-in date functions for the date range by hardcoding the start and end dates, and we rely on the given week_id format.\n\nSQL Code:\n```sql\nWITH weekly_sales AS (\n    SELECT \n        week_id,\n        SUM(amt) AS sales_amt\n    FROM \n        dm_fact_sales_chatbi\n    WHERE \n        date_code BETWEEN '2025-02-01' AND '2025-02-28'\n        AND comp_flag = 'Y'  -- Only comparable stores\n    GROUP BY \n        week_id\n)\nSELECT \n    week_id,\n    sales_amt,\n    LAG(sales_amt) OVER (ORDER BY week_id) AS previous_week_sales,\n    CASE \n         WHEN LAG(sales_amt) OVER (ORDER BY week_id) = 0 \n              THEN 0 \n         ELSE (sales_amt / LAG(sales_amt) OVER (ORDER BY week_id)) - 1 \n    END AS weekly_comp_growth\nFROM \n    weekly_sales;\n```\n\nExplanation:  \n• The WITH clause (weekly_sales) aggregates sales (amt) per week_id for comparable stores within February 2025.  \n• The main SELECT uses the LAG window function to fetch the sales of the previous week (based on week_id ordering).  \n• The growth percentage is calculated as: (current week sales divided by previous week sales) minus 1. This metric represents the week-over-week comp growth %.  \n• If the previous week’s sales are zero, we output 0 to avoid division by zero.  \nThis SQL output enables business users to quickly assess the weekly growth trend in sales for the comp store segment during the month.",

Using the provided constraints and the fixed date range (today is February 20, 2025), we define the current week as the period from Sunday, February 16, 2025, to Wednesday, February 19, 2025, and the previous week as from Sunday, February 09, 2025, to Saturday, February 15, 2025. We then aggregate the untaxed sales amount (amt_notax) over these periods from the dm_fact_sales_chatbi table where the condition comp_flag = 'Y' ensures that only comparable stores are evaluated.

The final SELECT statement then compares these two aggregated sums to compute the growth percentage. If last week’s sales are zero (to avoid division by zero), the growth percentage is set to 0. The resulting output shows the sales amounts for both weeks and the calculated weekly comp growth percentage, making it easier for business users to evaluate the performance of comparable stores from one week to the next.",
