- week id: represented by a six- digit number in the format of 'yyyyww'. When users input data related to it, they might only enter 'week ww'. In such cases, we need to append an appropriate four- digit year ('yyyy') to form the complete 'week id'. There is a specific rule for determining this year. If the current date falls within the period from April 1st to December 31st, we should use the year of the current date plus 1. For example, if today's date is in this range in 2024, we would use 2025 for the year part when constructing the 'week id'. On the other hand, if the current date is between January 1st and March 31st, we should use the year of the current date itself. For instance, if today is within this range in 2025, we would use 2025 for the year part when forming the 'week id'. Please keep this rule in mind when processing any input related to 'week id' to ensure accurate results.
